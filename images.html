    <h2>JPEG</h2>
    <p>
        JPG images are good for <strong>photos</strong>

    <h2>GIF</h2>
    <p>
        GIF images are great for simple animations. However, never use them for photos. Difficult to get high levels of detail on a transparent background.

    <h2>PNG</h2>
    <p>
        PNGs are great for anything that isn't a photo or animated. Not sure what exactly is left after taking those out of the running!? Excellent for icons, diagrams, logos, etc.

    <h2>SVG</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Vector based graphics!!! Resize with abandon. Great for responsive design, so probably great for <em>mobile</em> -> PC browser and back. Used similarly to PNG.</strong>
